# Solvenius - Android

*Solvenius for Android*


## Introduction

[Solvenius](http://gianlucacosta.info/solvenius/) is a videogame which I created long ago - in 2001; over the years I have rewritten it a few times, and the current version is an *HTML 5 web app* powered by *Elm*.

This project is an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.gianlucacosta.solvenius), available on Google Play and written in *Kotlin*, that employs a thin layer of *JavaScript bridges* to embed the web app.


The benefits of such an approach over the plain web app are:

* The *back* button on the device actually performs a click on any *Back* button on the screen

* The app starts immediately - no need to pass through the *Start!* button

* Message dialogs have a meaningful caption

* The music stops when the app is paused

* The game can be played offline
